As such, there were eventually four bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, two of which were joint bids: England, Russia, Netherlands/Belgium, and Portugal/Spain.

The twenty-two-member [[FIFA Council|FIFA Executive Committee]] convened in [[Zürich]] on 2 December 2010 to vote to select the hosts of both tournaments.<ref name="2018+2022 bids">{{cite news|url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/federation/bodies/media/newsid=983481.html |title=Combined bidding confirmed |publisher=FIFA |date=20 December 2008 |accessdate=20 December 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122070321/http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/federation/bodies/media/newsid%3D983481.html |archivedate=22 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> Russia won the right to be the 2018 host in the second round of voting.

The process was not without criticism: allegations of bribery on the part of the Russian team and corruption from FIFA members were made particularly by the English [[Football Association]]. It was alleged that four members of the executive committee had requested bribes to vote for England, and [[Sepp Blatter]] said that it had already been arranged before the vote that Russia would win.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sports.vice.com/en_ca/article/3kzxzv/what-we-know-about-corruption-in-the-2018-and-2022-world-cup-bids|title=What We Know About Corruption in the 2018 And 2022 World Cup Bids|publisher=VICE Sports|accessdate=31 May 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180115001654/https://sports.vice.com/en_ca/article/3kzxzv/what-we-know-about-corruption-in-the-2018-and-2022-world-cup-bids|archivedate=15 January 2018|df=dmy-all}} </ref> The 2014 [[Garcia Report]], an internal investigation led by [[Michael J.

The draw was held on 1 December 2017, at 18:00 [[Moscow Time|MSK]], at the [[State Kremlin Palace]] in [[Moscow]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y=2017/m=1/news=final-draw-to-take-place-in-state-kremlin-palace-2864946.html|title=Final Draw to take place in State Kremlin Palace|publisher=FIFA.com|date=24 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171116185925/https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y=2017/m=1/news=final-draw-to-take-place-in-state-kremlin-palace-2864946.html|archivedate=16 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/0/world-cup-draw-2018-date-time-does-start-could-england-get/|title=Final Draw to take place at 18:00|publisher=telegraph.co.uk|date=24 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171125212925/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/0/world-cup-draw-2018-date-time-does-start-could-england-get/|archivedate=25 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The 32 teams were drawn into eight groups of four.

For the draw, the teams were allocated to four pots based on the [[FIFA World Rankings]] of October 2017. Pot 1 contained the hosts Russia (who were automatically assigned to Position A1) and the best seven teams, Pot 2 contained the next best eight teams, and so on for Pots 3 and 4.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/news/y=2017/m=9/news=oc-for-fifa-competitions-approves-procedures-for-the-final-draw-of-the-2907924.html|title=OC for FIFA Competitions approves procedures for the Final Draw of the 2018 FIFA World Cup|publisher=FIFA.com|date=14 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110171903/https://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/news/y=2017/m=9/news=oc-for-fifa-competitions-approves-procedures-for-the-final-draw-of-the-2907924.html|archivedate=10 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> This was different from previous draws, where only Pot 1 was based on FIFA Rankings while the remaining pots were based on geographical considerations. However, still retained was the fact that teams from the same confederation were not drawn against each other for the group stage, except for UEFA where each group contained up to two teams.

Each team had to name a preliminary squad of 35 players. From the preliminary squad, the team had to name a final squad of 23 players (three of whom must be goalkeepers) by 4 June. Players in the final squad may be replaced due to serious injury up to 24 hours prior to kickoff of the team's first match and such replacements do not need to have been named in the preliminary squad.<ref name="regulations">{{cite web|url=https://resources.fifa.com/image/upload/2018-fifa-world-cup-russiatm-regulations-2843519.pdf?cloudid=ejmfg94ac7hypl9zmsys|title=Regulations – 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia|publisher=FIFA.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170712134322/http://resources.fifa.com/mm/document/tournament/competition/02/84/35/19/regulationsfwc2018en_neutral.pdf|archivedate=12 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In October 2011, Russia decreased the number of stadiums from 16 to 14.

The final choice of host cities was announced on 29 September 2012. The number of cities was further reduced to 11 and number of stadiums to 12 as Krasnodar and Yaroslavl were dropped from the final list. Of the 12 stadiums used for the tournament, 3 (Luzhniki, Yekaterinburg and Sochi) have been extensively renovated and the other 9 stadiums to be used are brand new; $11.8 billion has been spent on hosting the tournament.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/russia2018/organisation/media/newsid=1711717/index.html?intcmp=fifacom_hp_module_media_statements |title=2018 FIFA World Cup™ to be played in 11 Host Cities |publisher=fifa.com |date=29 September 2012 |accessdate=29 September 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140708201259/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/russia2018/organisation/media/newsid=1711717/index.html?intcmp=fifacom_hp_module_media_statements |archivedate=8 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Sepp Blatter stated in July 2014 that due to concerns over the completion of venues in Russia, the number of venues for the tournament may be reduced from 12 to 10. He also said, "We are not going to be in a situation, as is the case of one, two or even three stadiums [[2010 FIFA World Cup|in South Africa]], where it is a problem of what you do with these stadiums".<ref name=saakov>{{cite news |first1=Rafael |last1=Saakov |title=Russia 2018: Major challenges for next World Cup hosts |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-28409784 |work=BBC News |date=22 July 2014 |accessdate=29 July 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728161154/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-28409784 |archivedate=28 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Of the 12 venues used, the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow and the Saint Petersburg Stadium (the two largest stadiums in Russia) will be used most, with 7 matches being played at each of these stadiums. Sochi, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara will host 6 matches including one quarter-final match apiece, and the Otkrytiye Stadium in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don will host 5 matches apiece including one round of 16 match each. Volgograd, Kaliningrad, Yekaterinburg, and Saransk will host 4 matches each and none of these cities will host any knockout stage games.

The tournament logo was unveiled on 28 October 2014 by cosmonauts at the [[International Space Station]] and then projected onto Moscow's [[Bolshoi Theatre]] during an evening television programme. Russian Sports Minister [[Vitaly Mutko]] said that the logo was inspired by "Russia's rich artistic tradition and its history of bold achievement and innovation", and FIFA President [[Sepp Blatter]] stated that it reflected the "heart and soul" of the country.<ref>{{cite news |title='Russia’s heart & soul': World Cup 2018 logo unveiled in Moscow (PHOTOS, VIDEO) |url=http://rt.com/news/200231-russia-world-cup-logo/ |accessdate=29 October 2014 |publisher=RT |date=28 October 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029144914/http://rt.com/news/200231-russia-world-cup-logo/ |archivedate=29 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> For the branding, a typeface called ''Dusha'' (from Душа, Russian for ''soul'') was created by Portuguese design agency Brandia Central in 2014.

[[File:Rus-IvoryCoast (13).jpg|thumb|Tournament mascot, wolf Zabivaka]]
The [[FIFA World Cup mascot|official mascot]] for the tournament was unveiled 21 October 2016, and selected through a design competition among university students. A public vote was used to select from three finalists—a cat, a tiger, and a wolf. The winner, with 53% of approximately 1 million votes, was Zabivaka—an [[anthropomorphic]] wolf dressed in the colors of the Russian national team. Zabivaka's name is derived from the Russian word ''забива́ть'', "to strike", and his official backstory states that he is an aspiring football player who is "charming, confident and social".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/21/russia-2018-zabivaka-world-cup-mascot|title=Russia 2018: World Cup mascot Zabivaka the wolf unveiled in Moscow|last=sport|first=Guardian|date=2016-10-21|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325112015/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/21/russia-2018-zabivaka-world-cup-mascot|archivedate=25 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Broadcasting rights==
{{See also|2018 FIFA World Cup broadcasting rights}}

FIFA, through several companies, sold the broadcasting rights for the 2018 FIFA World Cup to various local broadcasters.

In the United States, the 2018 World Cup will be the first men's World Cup whose English rights will be held by [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]], and Spanish rights held by [[Telemundo Deportes|Telemundo]]. The elimination of the U.S. national team in qualifying led to concerns that U.S. interest and viewership of this World Cup would be reduced (especially among "casual" viewers interested in the U.S. team), especially noting how much Fox paid for the rights, and that U.S. games at the 2014 World Cup peaked at 16.5 million viewers. During a launch event prior to the elimination, Fox stated that it had planned to place a secondary focus on the Mexican team in its coverage to take advantage of their popularity among U.S. viewers (factoring [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]]). Fox stated that it was still committed to broadcasting a significant amount of coverage for the tournament.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/sports/soccer/world-cup-soccer.html|title=Fox and Others Will Feel Pain of U.S. Absence at World Cup|last=Draper|first=Kevin|date=11 October 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=26 October 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171024072730/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/sports/soccer/world-cup-soccer.html|archivedate=24 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.si.com/tech-media/2017/10/11/usa-world-cup-elimination-fox-sports-coverage-mexico-el-tri|title=USMNT elimination is a disaster for Fox Sports|work=SI.com|access-date=26 October 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171026111153/https://www.si.com/tech-media/2017/10/11/usa-world-cup-elimination-fox-sports-coverage-mexico-el-tri|archivedate=26 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-11/fox-is-said-to-project-20-million-in-lost-world-cup-ad-sales|title=Fox Projects Up to $20 Million in Lost World Cup Ad Sales|date=11 October 2017|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=26 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171026111201/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-11/fox-is-said-to-project-20-million-in-lost-world-cup-ad-sales|archivedate=26 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
